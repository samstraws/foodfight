To run our test system, please run "make clean" then "make build" and finally run 
"make test" in the terminal 
  (Note: You may need to run "cd Command" first to get inside the Command
  directory that houses everything). 

In order to play the actual game, please run "make play" in the terminal.

Instructions for playing game:
  To play the game please choose the mode you'd like to play in (single player
  or 2 player). In single player, you'll play the computer while in 2 player you
  fight another person.

  The goal is to defeat your opponent by reducing the health of all of the foods
  of their character to 0.  

  Players will take turns attacking each other (one round consists of a move
  from each character).  Players can either use their current food to make a 
  move or they can choose to switch out their current food for a different one.
  You can reduce your opponent's health by using the attacks available to the
  current food, heal your own current food if you have a heal, or do a little of
  both with a drain move. Choose a move by typing in the name of it.

  If the health of a food goes to zero, that food has "Expired" and can no
  longer be used to make moves. Once all the character's foods expire, the 
  character is dead and the game ends.

  Special Feature: In the 2 player mode, you have the option to customize your
  own character and use them to play: You can choose their name, and three foods
  that they can use.
